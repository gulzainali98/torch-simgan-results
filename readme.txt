Directory "1" contains the results of the model trained on Tony Shin's preprocessed data(https://github.com/shinseung428/simGAN_NYU_Hand)
Directory "2" contains results of the model trained on my preprocessed data. 
Directory "3" contains the results of the model trained on my pre processed data which was further cropped using synthetic images
as mentioned in the paper. 
Directory "4" contains the results of the latest trained model. This directory contains the images of all the new models i am testing.

project.avi is the video created by stitching all the test images together in directory "4"

I made some changes in hyper parameters while training on my data. Both models were tested on single test dataset from NYU hand 
which was pre processed using my script.
